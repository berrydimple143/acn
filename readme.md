# Documentation of how this system works in a step-by-step method
1. Go to https://ausreg.net/. Then select a State in the dropdown list and afterwards choose a Region and press the red button "Go There". Caution: Some of the regions are not yet ready but mostly all of them are. 
2. When you get to a particular location after clicking the "Go There" button you can see the url above has changed from https://ausreg.net/ into something like https://albury.guide/ depending on what region you've selected. Notice the site's background is also changing depending on the location you are in. In the upper right corner you can see the button "Create your Ads Events or Article" with an animated red arror pointing to this. Click this one and you will be redirected to https://login.ausreg.net/index.php/login
3. After that you'll see a login page with different choices to login. When you choose the button "Create an Account or Login with Mobile" you'll be redirected to a page where you'll have to provide your mobile phone number (in this system it is set to australian mobile phone numbers +61). This will automatically create an account and log you in as well.
4. When you choose to login with facebook by clicking the button "Sign in with Facebook" this will also automatically create an account for you fetching details from facebook such as name and email and then log you in as well.
5. And of course, it has also a traditional login where you'll provide your email and password if you already have an account in this system. 
6. The "Forgot your Password" link will take you to a page where you'll provide the email address you've used in this system and also with added captcha for security reasons.
7. The "Tell a Friend" button will take you to a page where you can invite a friend to the system by sending a personal email.
